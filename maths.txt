A solid is formed by adjoining twispheres to the ends of a right circular cylinder. An industrial tank of this shape must have a volume of 1600 cubic feet. The hemispherical ends cost twice as much per square foot of surface area as the sides. Find the dimensions (in ft) that will minimize the cost. (Round your answers to three decimal places.)
