Consider a particle moving along the x-axis where x(t) is the position of the particle at time t, x′(t) is its velocity, and x″(t) is its acceleration.
A particle moves along the x-axis at a velocity of 
v(t) = 3⁄ square roo(t)
,
 where 
t > 0.
 At time 
t = 1,
 its position is 
x = 10.
 Find the acceleration and position functions for the particle.
